**Project - IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project**

**Introduction:**

You have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants. To keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, your organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. 

As a Data Analyst, you will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. 

Your first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in-demand from various sources including:

- Job postings
- Training portals
- Surveys

Once you have collected enough data, you will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following:

- What are the top programming languages in demand?
- What are the top database skills in demand?
- What are the popular IDEs?

You will begin by scraping internet websites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like .csv files, excel sheets, and databases.   
 
Once this is completed, you will make that data ready for analysis using data-wrangling techniques. 

When the data is ready you will then want to apply statistical techniques to analyze the data. Then bring all of your information together by using IBM Cognos Analytics to create your dashboard. And finally, show off your storytelling skills by sharing your findings in a presentation.


**Required Skills:**

Data Collection   
- Using APIs to collect jobs data and storing the data in an Excel spreadsheet (Python libraries: request, pandas, and openpyxl).  
- Using web scraping to retrieve data from a website and saving the data into a CSV file (Python libraries: request, pandas, and BeautifulSoup).  
- Exploring a data set by loading the dataset, finding the number of rows and columns, and identifying the data types of each column (Python library: pandas, pandas methods (read_csv(), head(), shape, dtypes)).

Data wrangling  
- Finding and removing duplicated rows (Python library: pandas, pandas methods (duplicated(), drop_duplicates())).
- Finding and imputing (replacing) missing values with other meaningful values (Python library: pandas, pandas methods (value_counts(), idxmax(), isna()).  
- Normalizing relevant columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Determining how data is distributed (histogram plot).
- Finding the outliers in a dataset and removing them (calculate Q1, Q2 (median), Q3, and Inter Quartile Range (IQR)).  
- Finding the correlation among features in the dataset (Python library: pandas, pandas method (.corr())).

Data Visualization   
- Using SQL knowledge.
- Using Python libraries (matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, pandas) to plot graphs and visualize distribution (histogram, boxplot), relationship (scatter plot, bubble plot), composition (pie chart, stacked chart), and comparison (line chart, bar chart) of data in the dataset.

Building dashboard  
-  Using IBM Cognos Analytics to make various charts and assemble a dashboard.

Presentation of Findings
- Final Presentation in PowerPoint.

- Final Presentation in PowerPoint.
